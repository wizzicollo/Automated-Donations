        The `authenticate` method is called on every request regardless whether
        the endpoint requires authentication or not

        `authenticate` has to possible return values:

        1) `None` - We return None if we do not wish to authenticate. Usually, this
                    means we know that authentication will fail. Eg. when a user does
                    not include a token in the headers

        2) `{user, token}` - We return user/token combination when authentication is successful

            If neither of the conditions are met, we do not return anything
            We simply raise the `AuthenticationFailed` exception and let DRF
